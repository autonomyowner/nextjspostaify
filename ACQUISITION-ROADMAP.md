## Scripts & Templates

### DM Scripts

#### DM Script #1: Initial Outreach (Cold)
```
Hey [Name]!

Saw your post about [specific struggle they mentioned]. I totally get it - I used to spend 8+ hours a week on social media content too.

Quick question: what's your biggest content headache right now - coming up with ideas, writing captions, or creating visuals?
```

#### DM Script #2: After They Reply
```
That's exactly why I built POSTAIFY - it's an AI tool that creates a full month of content in about 15 minutes.

I'm looking for 10 coaches to try it free and give honest feedback before we launch publicly.

Want me to set you up with early access?
```

#### DM Script #3: Follow-Up (No Reply)
```
Hey [Name]! Just floating this back up in case you missed it.

I know content creation is a huge time suck. If you ever want to try an AI tool that handles it in minutes, the offer for free early access is still open.

No pressure either way!
```

#### DM Script #4: Partnership Outreach
```
Hey [Name]!

Love your content on [specific thing]. Your posts about [topic] really resonate.

I built an AI tool called POSTAIFY that helps coaches create a month of content in 15 minutes. I'd love to offer you lifetime Pro access to try it.

If you find it valuable, maybe you could share it with your audience? No obligation at all - just want to get it in the hands of coaches who "get it."

Interested?

### Group Post Templates

#### Post Template #1: Value Post (Content Ideas)
```
📝 5 content ideas for coaches this week (steal these):

1. Share a client win (anonymized) + the lesson
2. "Myth vs Reality" about your niche
3. Your morning routine and why it matters
4. Answer a FAQ you get from clients
5. Share a tool that saves you time

Which one are you posting first? 👇
```

#### Post Template #2: Pain Point Post
```
Real question for coaches:

How many hours do you spend on social media content each week?

I used to spend 8+ hours and it was killing my productivity.

Curious if others feel the same... 🤔
```

#### Post Template #3: Tips Post
```
3 ways to create content faster (what actually works):

✓ Batch your content - create a week's worth in one sitting
✓ Repurpose everything - one idea = 5 posts
✓ Use templates - stop starting from scratch

What's your best content hack? Share below 👇
```

#### Post Template #4: Story Post
```
I almost quit coaching because of social media.

Spending 10+ hours a week on content, feeling like I was running on a hamster wheel, watching other coaches grow faster...

Then I realized: the problem wasn't my content. It was my PROCESS.

Now I create a month of content in one afternoon.

The secret? Having a system.

Anyone else feel this content burnout? 🙋‍♀️
```

#### Post Template #5: Waitlist Urgency Post
```
Building something for coaches and I need beta testers...

It's an AI tool that creates social media content in minutes instead of hours.

Looking for 20 coaches to try it FREE before we launch next week.

In exchange, just honest feedback.

First 50 who join the waitlist also get 50% off when we launch.

Comment "INTERESTED" and I'll send details.
```

#### Post Template #6: Launch Post
```
After 3 months of building and testing with 20+ coaches...

It's an AI tool that creates your social media content - posts, images, even voiceovers - in minutes.
